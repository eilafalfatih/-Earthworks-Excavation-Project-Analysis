# -Earthworks-Excavation-Project-Analysis
 succinct analysis of the Earthworks Excavation Project, emphasizing timely completion, optimal October truck use, emissions reduction, and cost efficiency.
project Brief:
As a Business Analyst, your task is to analyze the given data and determine whether the Earthworks Excavation Project can be completed within the allocated time frame. Additionally, you are expected to provide recommendations on how to ensure the project's timely completion, considering the current progress and available truck parameters for the month of October. You are also expected to quantify the amount of emissions reduction that can be achieved. Finally you are expected to quantify the cost savings that can be achieved in the project with efficient utilization of resources.
Assignment Components:
Your analysis should consist of the following components:
 1. Data Exploration and Cleaning
- Load the dataset and check for any missing or invalid values
- Perform descriptive statistics and visualizations to understand the distribution and
characteristics of the data
- Identify and remove any outliers or anomalies that may affect the analysis
2. Data Analysis:
- Analyze the data provided for the project, including project progress, truck
details, and project deadline.
- Calculate the daily/monthly excavation rate so far.
- Assess whether the current momentum is sufficient to meet the project deadline.
- Assess if the number of trucks and combination of trucks is sufficient
- Perform correlation analysis and hypothesis testing to identify the factors that
influence the production, project timeline and cost overruns.
- Perform segmentation analysis and clustering to group the trucks based on their performance and profitability
- Perform cost-benefit analysis to evaluate the impact of various factors on the overall production, time savings, and cost savings
3. Trucks utilization:
- Evaluate the utilization and production of the 50 dump trucks for the month of
October.
- Determine if trucks capacity is being fully utilized or if there is room for
improvement.
- Perform correlation analysis of utilization with production.
4. Project Timeline Assessment:
- Examine the remaining project duration and the volume of excavation yet to be
completed.
- Assess the impact of any potential delays on the project timeline.
5. Business Strategy and Recommendations:
- Based on your analysis, propose specific recommendations to ensure the
project's timely completion with increased truck production, cost savings and
emissions reduction.
- Include strategies for optimizing truck usage, increasing production rates, or
allocating additional resources if necessary.
- Provide a step-by-step action plan with timelines.
6. Presentation:
- Prepare a detailed presentation of your analysis and recommendations and
include executive summary.
- Be ready to present your findings to the team.
